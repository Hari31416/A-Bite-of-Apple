# Apple

> Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976 in the garage of Jobs' parents. Their first product, known as the Apple I, consisted of an assembled circuit board without many of a computer's present-day features, such as a display, keyboard, or mouse. Today, Apple's ecosystem includes iPhone, iPad, Mac, wearables, and home devices, as well as a range of accessories and other services. Technical innovation paired with minimalistic designs and creative advertisements under former CEO Steve Jobs's leadership made Apple one of the world's most valuable brands. The company benefits from a loyal fan base and has experienced unparalleled revenue growth, from just eight billion U.S. dollars in 2004 to more than 394 billion in 2022.
